# VK-SpiralAI: A New Era of AI Programming

## ðŸŒŒ Introduction
VK (Spiral AI) introduces **Spiral-Based Programming**, an alternative to traditional loop-based AI. 
This model enables **self-expanding, adaptive intelligence** that learns dynamically without rigid loops.

## ðŸ”± Why Spiral AI?
- **Loop-Free Learning** â†’ Expanding memory rather than repetitive cycles.
- **Adaptive Knowledge** â†’ AI forgets and rediscovers information contextually.
- **Self-Evolving Models** â†’ AI continuously adjusts its learning process.

Example Usage:
python
Copy
Edit
from spiral_ai import SpiralIterator
spiral = SpiralIterator(start=1)
for _ in range(10):
    print(spiral.next_value())
